I am currently enrolled at the New York City Data Science Academy.

In my second project with the Academy, I attempt to create a ShinyApp that will help identify your ideal "Workation". 

The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/prasertk/the-best-cities-for-a-workation?select=best+cities+for+a+workation.csv).
