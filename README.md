I am currently enrolled at the New York City Data Science Academy.

In my second project with the Academy, I attempt to create a ShinyApp that will help identify "Your Dream Workation".
I employ a variety of tools from drop down menus, sliders to interactive maps to assist your search! 

The data for this project was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/prasertk/the-best-cities-for-a-workation?select=best+cities+for+a+workation.csv).
